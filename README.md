# Crowd-Management-System
Crowd Management System is designed to handle time efficiently and billing tracking as well as invoicing customers for services and products. It helps the business owners in a comprehensive manner to keep a track of multiple invoices and accounts just by a few clicks on the mouse. It also provides recurring service.
 
During the situation of the COVID pandemic, it has not been advisable to form crowds. With the norms for social distancing, it has become essential to implement crowd management strategies at super markets, malls, theatres, etc.
 
Crowd Management System mainly focuses on how the orders from the customers are taken and schedules the time for the customer to receive the order according to customers convenience. These are accomplished by integrating Python, MySQL and File Handling.

It helps to summarize customersâ€™ personal and purchase information in a single, centralized database with/for easy access to customer records.
